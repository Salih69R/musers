 The problem it solves:

in the music industry, networking is key. if you want to be in a band, you need to know people (the members of the band, band manager) if you don't want a band and you do your work with paid players, you need people (the people that will play) even if you just play your guitar and sing, to play a gig, you need people (the people of the location you'll play at, the stage men, the sound men, the distributers).

and not just for gigs and concerts, if you want to record an album, you need people (the sound engineer, the distributers...)

the idea is, to put a musical product out there and hope to make some pay out of it, you need people that will put you in the loop and even though it's been getting easier for musicians to do their thing since the internet (on facebook and youtube and searching services in google)

Musers give musicians and people who work with musicians the platform to connect and jump to save the day when a fellow Muser posts looking for help, or the other way around

The core features and how they solve the problem:

profile for every user, kinda like a resume in the musical industry

5 types of posts to find what you need:

a) "I'm a musician, i'm looking for musicians to jam with for fun"

b) "I'm a music industry worker, I'm offering a non-musical service" (i'm a soundman, i'm a stage man, i'm a distributer....)

c) "I'm a musician, I'm offering my musical service" (i'll play a gig for you, or play in an album, or write you a song...)

d) "I need a music industry worker, I'm asking for a non-musical service"

e) "I need a musician , I'm asking for a musical service"

a search engine that finds the posts by type (like above)

Quick explanation of the complementary features:

after finding a post and deciding to engage if you like what you see, you can:

chat (to discuss the deal or whatever the post was about)
follow the user (to stay in touch for further work in the future)
comment (helpful to network based on the post's viewers)
in a post, you can post pics, vids, sound and text
